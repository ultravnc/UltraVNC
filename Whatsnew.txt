**************************************


** v1.0.2 Release

- Resizable FileTransfer window
- Improved cursor handling in viewer and javaviewer
- Improved Autoreconnect option in server
- Improved query-on-incoming-connection window in server
- MSLogon improvements
- MSLogon weak challenge vulnerability fix
  NOTE: MSLogon backward compatibility is broken with versions
  <= v1.0.1
  Anyway, the new v1.0.2 viewer can use MSLogon with older servers
  but a warning is displayed recommending server upgrade.
- Server and viewer logging functions vulnerability fix
- Server configuration: AlphaBlending, FTUserImpersonation and
  LockWorkstation options are allowed depending on the OS
- MSRC4 DSM plugin v1.2.0 embedded into the setup
  ("plugin" subdirectory). The .dsm files must be manually copied
  into the UltraVNC install directory, along Ultra binaries.
  Many enhancements in this new plugin (session key salting, connection
  still possible without key file...). Thanks Sean !


** v1.0.1 Release

- Slow FileTransfer (viewer -> server) over LAN: fixed
- Slow applications on viewer machine during FileTransfer
  (viewer -> server): fixed (other applications are now usable...)

- Removed session switch running as application (disconnect as app RDP)
- TextChat display corruption when lot of text was typed: fixed
- FileTransfer temporization is no more used when main viewer window is mimimized
  (=> max. speed transfer)
- Updated zlib library to v1.2.3
- Changed Modem/Slow profile encoding in Auto mode, from ZRLE to Tight:
  it should fix the occasional viewer crash over slow connections in auto mode


** v1.0.0 Release

- Cosmetics and language correction for server and viewer
- Driver activation (v100)
- Resources corrections (radio buttuns)
- Manual close viewer demaon

- XP look



** v1.0.0 - RC20 4
- Internal test version



** v1.0.0 - RC20 (.1, .2, .3)

- FileTransfer bugs seem all fixed this time. All the regressions due to the
  new asynchronous transfer mode + delta transfer should be solved.

- New FileTransfer Impersonation mode.
  Available only when WinVNC is run as a service.
  A user that connects to WinVNC and that is not yet identified by
  the server (Windows authentication, so he can see the Windows login screen)
  has no access to the server's filesystem through UltraVNC FileTransfer GUI.
  He must login into Windows first. Once identified, the user only has access
  to the filesystem resources allowed by his Windows profile.
  This mode can be desactivated by an admin if necessary:
    "FTUserImpersonation=0" in the WinVNC registry branch. In this case, the
    whole filesystem can be accessed by users, without restriction, like in
    previous UltraVNC FileTransfer versions.

- New color modes: 64 colors, 8 colors, 8 GreyScale, 4 GreyScale, 2 B&W

- The JavaViewer also supports the new color modes

- The WinVNC embedded HTML container for the JavaViewer now displays
  a warning saying that the Java VM must be installed on the Web Browser machine
  in order to get the JavaViewer working.

- Various small bugs fixes:
  - Forced X-cursor encoding sent to viewers: fixed
  - Bad minor version number sent causing Chat not supported (Server->Viewer): fixed
  - Command line ignored-options bug: fixed
  - NT4 Crash: fixed
  - DSM plugin mechanism: new Reset function added and bug fixed
    (note that versions of MSRC4 Plugins > 1.1.4 must now be used with RC20)
  - System resources and small memory leaks: fixed
  - Some registry settings bugs: fixed

- New "modern" dialog boxes look (XP)

- Slighlty redesigned and tweaked dialog boxes both in Vncviewer and WinVNC
  so they are more readable and look better.

- MSLogon II: lot of new features and bug fixes (see whatsnew.txt for details)

- Optional Alpha-Blending capture mode

- Optional Alpha-Blending screen-blanking mode (see whatsnew.txt for details)

- Last Viewer settings are automatically saved in a "latest.vnc" file in current
  users's "local settings" Win directory. So next time the user runs the viewer
  these settings are automatically reloaded.

- New single-http-connect port support. A separate WinVNC1P.exe is available
  and necessary to get this functionnality. This new fonctionnality will be
  included in the regular Ultra WinVNC as soon as possible.

- New Single-Click UltraVNC server. The Setup can be customized and generated
  online on the uvnc web site. Please see the Forum and Website for details.




** v1.0.0 - RC19.7

- FileTransfer fixes
- Registry (service) fixes
- Blank screen now uses layered window (W2k)
- DSM Plugin fixes
- AlphaBlending can be activated via the WinVNC admin option pannel
- CPU Blank screen
  CPU Screen Blanking is fixed by using a layered window.
  (option admin pannel)
  It only works on W2k/XP/W2003
  Doesn't work in combination with the driver
  If Alpha blanking can not be used, the older DPMS method is used instead (auto)
  The Screen Blanking with AlphaBlending can show some content on the screen, 
  if you create a "Background.bmp" file in Winvnc directory, this bitmap is used 
  instead of the default black background.
  Alpha ScreenBlanking can not Hide the Cursor, and sometimes the menus go to the foreground.


** v1.0.0 - RC19.6

- Extra registry parameter "CaptureAlphaBlending"
- Winvnc1P.exe (1 port for http, seperate version , don't now status with normal viewer and plugins)

** v1.0.0 - RC19.3

- MSlogon I changes

  logging.dll: needed, does event and file logging
  authadmin.dll: if present, give localadmin access
  workgrpnt4.dll: Workgroup and NT4 domain checking
  ldapauth.dll:Active directory W2K up
  ldapauth9x.dll:Active Directory 9X
  ldapauthnt4.dll:Active Directory NT4
  Only the logging.dll is needed, If other dll's do not exist,
  that specific check is skipped.
  If you remove authadmin --> Local admin has no access
  If you have active directory,workgrpnt4 is not needed

- Bug fixes:
  NT4 crash
  FileTransfer fixes

- Viewer use the selected language
  To manually change the language of the viewer, copy the correcponding
  xxx.dll from the /lang directory as lang.dll in the viewer directory



** v1.0.0 - RC 19 (v1 Release Candidate 19)

 - Semi "Fast User switching support

  For each user session you switch to, a seperate winvnc server is started on the next port.
  User session A on 5900, after user switch, viewer get black.
  User session B on 5901 gets active, after switching back to session A,
  first user session viewer get back active

 - Shutdown

  Shutdown, vnc stops as last service. Needs to be tested,
  because vnc is not stopped at all, service breaks when network become unavailable.

 - Bug fixes

  Screensaver and lock screen caused server hung running as application, fixed
  logon blocks, and screensaver resolution changes are better handled.
  Plugin had a realy bad network behaviour, fast small updates like in
  "Starfield screensaver preview" could crash your network ....
  Manual update after logon/screensaver fixed
  Fixed blank screen and XP SP2
  Cancel button in vncviewer fixed (now it actually stop connection process)

 - Video Hook Driver mode

  Extra driver version check on startup 1.018/1.017/1.017 for driver files,
  else driver is disabled
  Extra driver check button in properties menu. Gives driver status

 - Performance

  Network traffic is send in 8k blocks (avoid flooding on wireless)
  Local mouse handling react faster on cursor change

 - System shutdown

  Viewer should now stay connected until you get the logoff screen

 - WinVNC Properties handling

  User settings (only poll settings, access for all users)
  Admin settings (all other critical settings, access for administrators only)
  In service mode, no user settings are used, excepted polling ones
  Only the primary session can open the Admin properties "FUS"

 - Multi-headed display (multi monitors support)

  Without Video Driver: user can toggle between primary or secundary display
  With Video Driver: switch toggle primary,secondary or both displays
  Selection is done using the "Full Desktop" Toolbar Button (which is normally used
  to toggle from Single Window to Desktop modes)
  "Server cursor handle", not supported if secundary screen is left (with driver)
  Tested on 2 card system

 - Java Viewer

  Now supports FileTransfer (same kind of GUI than in win32 Viewer, but simpler...
  more functions will be added gradually (multiselection of files, directory transfer..)
   -> the JavaViewer now needs to access the viewing machine harddrive, so the user is
      prompted for an "UltraVNC" signed applet certificate acceptance.
  Support MS Logon authentication method

 - FileTransfer

  Now supports Delta Transfer for files (-> also provides Resume Interrupted transfer)
  Now transfers are asynchronous if wanted:
   When FT GUI is visible -> no screen updates, max speed for the transfer of files
   When FT GUI is minimized -> screen updates and file transfering at the same time
  Added multiselection for files deletion
  Added Rename File/Directory command
  Fixed some bugs with Directory Transfer (names with "(" or ")")
  Fixed huge files transfers and progress gauge corrupted display (> 2GB files)
  Added progress percentage value display
  A lot of code cleaning and sanity checks (both in Viewer and Server)
  New Viewer FilTransfer is still backward compatible with previous Servers (<=RC18)
  Directory Names are now surrounded with "[ " and " ]" in the GUI lists

 - MSlogon

MSlogon II 
Added a new MS-Logon authentication method (aka MS-Logon II). 
Should work with Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows 2003. 
(See mslogon.html for a detailed description) 
- Ability to authenticate cross-domain, i.e. the user account 
  can be in another domain than the computer account. 
- Stores access settings in an ACL: 
  Unlimited number of users/groups can be configured 
  Each user/group can have full access/viewonly 
- New UI: Standard MS Security Editor
- MSLogonACL: Tool for exporting/importing ACL 
- Only one (1) Windows logon attempt is performed. 
Bug fixes: 
* Fixed: Usernames with spaces fail to load with MSLogonACL tool 
  (see http://forum.ultravnc.net/viewtopic.php?t=1046&highlight=#4025) 
* Fixed: Extended ASCII characters (ä/ö/ü/ç) lead to authentication failure 
  (see http://forum.ultravnc.net/viewtopic.php?t=1259&highlight=#4702) 
* Fixed: Certain passwords (e.g. Abc0DefG) lead to authentication failure 
  (see http://forum.ultravnc.net/viewtopic.php?t=803)

   - Pressing ALT or CTRL send ALT/CTRL directly to the VNCServer, as if the user selected "CTRL
     DOWN/CTRL UP/ALT DOWN/ALT UP" from the system menu.
     When turning the SCROLL-LOCK on, the following things happen:
     Pressing ALT+TAB DOES NOT switch applications on the client side. Instead, ALT+TAB is sent to
     the VNCServer.
     Pressing CTRL+ESC DOES NOT open the start menu on the client side. Instead, CTRL+ESC is sent to
     the VNCServer.
     Pressing ALT+SPACE DOES NOT open the system menu on the client side. Instead, ALT+SPACE is sent
     to the VNCServer.
     Pressing Break/Pause key toggles Full-Screen mode on or off.
     Pressing PRINT-Screen key requests a full screen update (same as selecting "Request Screen
     Refresh" from the system menu)
     All the above can be disabled by turning the SCROLL-LOCK key off.

   the hostname in the task bar).

 - Added hostname in the FileTransfer window Title bar.

 - Hopefully fixed the scaling crash that occurs in
   all others VNC distributions due to the StretchBlt()
   function + hardware acceleration. 
   Visual quality remains equivalent when scaled.

 - Added a 30s delay between 2 encoding changes when
   using Auto mode. It should prevent some problems
   over slow connections...

     - "ms-logon + no domain + WinVNC under win 9.x" case
     - OS Version is better checked when Video Driver is required by user

   - Fixed the scaling factors corruption problem when using "AUTO" quickoption in 
     the viewer.

   - The DSM Plugins know their loader : vncviewer or WinVNC (application
     or service). It should be now more easy for plugins writters to save their plugins
     configuration at the good location in the registry, for instance.
     TestPlugin example source code has been updated consequently. 





 ** RC 1.07 (v1 Release Candidate 07)

   - Remove Wallpaper after disconnection bug fixed
   - NTML mechanism now checks Local and Remote for Group and Password.
   - Fixed a bug with changes detection in WINVNC under W2K/WP: when the
     "Video Hook Driver" option was checked and the Video Driver was not
     actually available (not installed for instance...) then the default
     "System HookDll" was not loaded (even if the option was checked).
     The result was missing screen updates, especially with checkboxes,
     low accuracy and low speed. The workaround was to uncheck the
     "Video Hook Driver" option.

   - DSMplugin action now starts BEFORE the RFB protocole handshaking 
     (-> 1.07 Viewer/Server DSM compatibility with 1.06 is broken
     but existing Plugins remain compatible with v1.07)
   - Info messages are now displayed when connection fails with DSMPlugin
     (Plugins incompatibility, missing etc...)
   - DSMPlugin now supports ms_logon method
   - Slightly modified TestPlugin sample
   - Added "dsmplugin" command line option in vncviewer

   - Video Driver handling:
     - Auto switching to default system hooking when 24bit color depth is used
       on server (the driver not used in this case)
     - 8bit color palette support
     - WinVNC keeps the attached-to-desktop bit to 1 until VNC unloads the
       driver -> No more crashes when an application changes the display
       (ex: pinball). No more risk that color depth or screen resolution
       switching crash the server.

   - New Video Hook driver v1.0.7 (+ New separate Video Drivers Auto-Setup)
