  elevated window is closed.
- Added reverse connection accept (like in old sc)
  usage: winvnc.exe -sc -run

** v1.0.5 Release
(v1.0.4 was never released. We switched directly to v1.0.5)

* Update 23 aug 2008

- Driver+applications that change resolution (like pinpall in fullscreen)
- vnclog : In some cases the standard path wasn't writable, now path can be set

* Update 13 aug 2008

- FT crash when clipboard is used during transfer fix
- Admin properties and domain user fix
- Inputlock input fix

* Update 3 aug 2008

- Exceptions thrown with no message cause access violations when Report called.
- All message boxes are now properly parented to the viewer window so that they
 are modal.
- Socket timeouts are now used during file transfer so that connections lost
 while connected to a repeater are detected
- A small keepalive message is sent every 5 seconds after receiving a file chunk
 to keep the server or viewer from timing out during a read.
- The prompt for exit is now respects the m_fExitCheck setting  if the 'x' in the
 full screen titlebar is clicked
- Another big change to the file transfer module is that a temporary file is used
 to hold the file being transferred. When it is successfully completes, it is
 moved to the original file name -- resume still works too. This was because
 when a file transfer is interrupted, a user (ie, service tech) can't tell
 if the file is complete.
- The close button on the file transfer dialog is now enabled and disabled during
 file transfers. You can't close the window with the 'x' during a transfer,
 but you can otherwise
- Many variables are now properly initialized.
- The black layered window is now brought to the top every 20ms -- the start menu
 is still visible on the remote system so this change makes it go away faster.
- You can now register the service with a custom name.
- Simplified Copy_to_temp and copy_to_secure_from_temp
- When the network connection is lost, a message is shown "Connection lost due to
 communication failure" instead of "writeexact: socket error while writing"
- socket read/write errors now break the while (connected) loop in vncclient.cpp
- Simplified file handle cleanup
- FT crash fix, lock screeen while transfer
- quickoption fix: Was not saved correct


* Update 10 July 2008

- Repeater: found bug that required server to be connected first.
 Now you can connect server or viewer first
- Viewer: option are now correct loaded.
 The problem was the the presets didn't have "manual set", this cause the presets
 always to be loaded on top of manual settings.
- Server now take as commandline
- Autoreconnect -id:???
- Single repeater connection server had a possible error ( reconnect couldn't
 happen if shutdown by service is requested)

 To use the registry instead, like in previous versions, do the following:
 1.Before running the uvnc_service for the first time, create an
   ultravnc.ini file in the UltravNC 1.0.3 RC2 install directory
 2.Add to this ultravnc.ini file the 2 following lines:
   [Admin]
   UseRegistry=1

 but a warning is displayed recommending server upgrade.
- Server and viewer logging functions vulnerability fix
- Server configuration: AlphaBlending, FTUserImpersonation and
 LockWorkstation options are allowed depending on the OS
- MSRC4 DSM plugin v1.2.0 embedded into the setup

** v1.0.0 - RC20 4
- Internal test version



** v1.0.0 - RC20 (.1, .2, .3)

- FileTransfer bugs seem all fixed this time. All the regressions due to the
 new asynchronous transfer mode + delta transfer should be solved.

- New FileTransfer Impersonation mode.
 Available only when WinVNC is run as a service.
 A user that connects to WinVNC and that is not yet identified by
 the server (Windows authentication, so he can see the Windows login screen)
 has no access to the server's filesystem through UltraVNC FileTransfer GUI.
 He must login into Windows first. Once identified, the user only has access
 to the filesystem resources allowed by his Windows profile.
 This mode can be desactivated by an admin if necessary:
   "FTUserImpersonation=0" in the WinVNC registry branch. In this case, the
   whole filesystem can be accessed by users, without restriction, like in
   previous UltraVNC FileTransfer versions.

- New color modes: 64 colors, 8 colors, 8 GreyScale, 4 GreyScale, 2 B&W

- The JavaViewer also supports the new color modes

- The WinVNC embedded HTML container for the JavaViewer now displays
 a warning saying that the Java VM must be installed on the Web Browser machine
 in order to get the JavaViewer working.

- Various small bugs fixes:
 - Forced X-cursor encoding sent to viewers: fixed
 - Bad minor version number sent causing Chat not supported (Server->Viewer): fixed
 - Command line ignored-options bug: fixed
 - NT4 Crash: fixed
 - DSM plugin mechanism: new Reset function added and bug fixed
   (note that versions of MSRC4 Plugins > 1.1.4 must now be used with RC20)
 - System resources and small memory leaks: fixed
 - Some registry settings bugs: fixed

- New "modern" dialog boxes look (XP)

- Slighlty redesigned and tweaked dialog boxes both in Vncviewer and WinVNC
 so they are more readable and look better.

- MSLogon II: lot of new features and bug fixes (see whatsnew.txt for details)

- Optional Alpha-Blending capture mode

- Optional Alpha-Blending screen-blanking mode (see whatsnew.txt for details)

- Last Viewer settings are automatically saved in a "latest.vnc" file in current
 users's "local settings" Win directory. So next time the user runs the viewer
 these settings are automatically reloaded.

- New single-http-connect port support. A separate WinVNC1P.exe is available
 and necessary to get this functionnality. This new fonctionnality will be
 included in the regular Ultra WinVNC as soon as possible.

- New Single-Click UltraVNC server. The Setup can be customized and generated
 online on the uvnc web site. Please see the Forum and Website for details.




** v1.0.0 - RC19.7

- FileTransfer fixes
- Registry (service) fixes
- Blank screen now uses layered window (W2k)
- DSM Plugin fixes
- AlphaBlending can be activated via the WinVNC admin option pannel
- CPU Blank screen
 CPU Screen Blanking is fixed by using a layered window.
 (option admin pannel)
 It only works on W2k/XP/W2003
 Doesn't work in combination with the driver
 If Alpha blanking can not be used, the older DPMS method is used instead (auto)
 The Screen Blanking with AlphaBlending can show some content on the screen,
 if you create a "Background.bmp" file in Winvnc directory, this bitmap is used
 instead of the default black background.
 Alpha ScreenBlanking can not Hide the Cursor, and sometimes the menus go to the foreground.


** v1.0.0 - RC19.6

- Extra registry parameter "CaptureAlphaBlending"
- Winvnc1P.exe (1 port for http, seperate version , don't now status with normal viewer and plugins)

- MS-Logon II: Unicode support (special chars)
- FileTransfer fixes


** v1.0.0 - RC19.3

- MSlogon I changes

 logging.dll: needed, does event and file logging
 authadmin.dll: if present, give localadmin access
 workgrpnt4.dll: Workgroup and NT4 domain checking
 ldapauth.dll:Active directory W2K up
 ldapauth9x.dll:Active Directory 9X
 ldapauthnt4.dll:Active Directory NT4
 Only the logging.dll is needed, If other dll's do not exist,
 that specific check is skipped.
 If you remove authadmin --> Local admin has no access
 If you have active directory,workgrpnt4 is not needed

- Bug fixes:
 NT4 crash
 FileTransfer fixes

- Viewer use the selected language
 To manually change the language of the viewer, copy the correcponding
 xxx.dll from the /lang directory as lang.dll in the viewer directory



** v1.0.0 - RC 19 (v1 Release Candidate 19)

 - Semi "Fast User switching support

 For each user session you switch to, a seperate winvnc server is started on the next port.
 User session A on 5900, after user switch, viewer get black.
 User session B on 5901 gets active, after switching back to session A,
 first user session viewer get back active

 - Shutdown

 Shutdown, vnc stops as last service. Needs to be tested,
 because vnc is not stopped at all, service breaks when network become unavailable.

 - Bug fixes

 Screensaver and lock screen caused server hung running as application, fixed
 logon blocks, and screensaver resolution changes are better handled.
 Plugin had a realy bad network behaviour, fast small updates like in
 "Starfield screensaver preview" could crash your network ....
 Manual update after logon/screensaver fixed
 Fixed blank screen and XP SP2
 Cancel button in vncviewer fixed (now it actually stop connection process)

 - Video Hook Driver mode

 Extra driver version check on startup 1.018/1.017/1.017 for driver files,
 else driver is disabled
 Extra driver check button in properties menu. Gives driver status

 - Performance

 Network traffic is send in 8k blocks (avoid flooding on wireless)
 Local mouse handling react faster on cursor change

 - System shutdown

 Viewer should now stay connected until you get the logoff screen

 - WinVNC Properties handling

 User settings (only poll settings, access for all users)
 Admin settings (all other critical settings, access for administrators only)
 In service mode, no user settings are used, excepted polling ones
 Only the primary session can open the Admin properties "FUS"

 - Multi-headed display (multi monitors support)

 Without Video Driver: user can toggle between primary or secundary display
 With Video Driver: switch toggle primary,secondary or both displays
 Selection is done using the "Full Desktop" Toolbar Button (which is normally used
 to toggle from Single Window to Desktop modes)
 "Server cursor handle", not supported if secundary screen is left (with driver)
 Tested on 2 card system

 - Java Viewer

 Now supports FileTransfer (same kind of GUI than in win32 Viewer, but simpler...
 more functions will be added gradually (multiselection of files, directory transfer..)
  -> the JavaViewer now needs to access the viewing machine harddrive, so the user is
     prompted for an "UltraVNC" signed applet certificate acceptance.
 Support MS Logon authentication method

 - FileTransfer

 Now supports Delta Transfer for files (-> also provides Resume Interrupted transfer)
 Now transfers are asynchronous if wanted:
  When FT GUI is visible -> no screen updates, max speed for the transfer of files
  When FT GUI is minimized -> screen updates and file transfering at the same time
 Added multiselection for files deletion
 Added Rename File/Directory command
 Fixed some bugs with Directory Transfer (names with "(" or ")")
 Fixed huge files transfers and progress gauge corrupted display (> 2GB files)
 Added progress percentage value display
 A lot of code cleaning and sanity checks (both in Viewer and Server)
 New Viewer FilTransfer is still backward compatible with previous Servers (<=RC18)
 Directory Names are now surrounded with "[ " and " ]" in the GUI lists

 - MSlogon

MSlogon II
Added a new MS-Logon authentication method (aka MS-Logon II).
Should work with Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows 2003.
(See mslogon.html for a detailed description)
- Ability to authenticate cross-domain, i.e. the user account
 can be in another domain than the computer account.
- Stores access settings in an ACL:
 Unlimited number of users/groups can be configured
 Each user/group can have full access/viewonly
- New UI: Standard MS Security Editor
- MSLogonACL: Tool for exporting/importing ACL
- Only one (1) Windows logon attempt is performed.
Bug fixes:
* Fixed: Usernames with spaces fail to load with MSLogonACL tool
 (see http://forum.ultravnc.net/viewtopic.php?t=1046&highlight=#4025)
* Fixed: Extended ASCII characters (ä/ö/ü/ç) lead to authentication failure

  - FileTransfer bug fix (possible infinite loop during copy loop)
  - Properties dialog tweaked
  - Removed the "Home page" and "Online help" shortcuts in the WinVNC traymenu
    (that were launching some IExplorer processes) until we find a better solution.

  * Viewer

  - Server Inputs/Screen-blanking bugfix
  - Proxy support (via the "VNC repeater" external program)
  - FileTransfer: selection bar now takes full list's window width
  - Several Listening viewers can now be run on the same machine using
    different ports numbers.
  - Pressing ALT or CTRL send ALT/CTRL directly to the VNCServer, as if the user selected "CTRL
    DOWN/CTRL UP/ALT DOWN/ALT UP" from the system menu.
    When turning the SCROLL-LOCK on, the following things happen:
    Pressing ALT+TAB DOES NOT switch applications on the client side. Instead, ALT+TAB is sent to
    the VNCServer.
    Pressing CTRL+ESC DOES NOT open the start menu on the client side. Instead, CTRL+ESC is sent to
    the VNCServer.
    Pressing ALT+SPACE DOES NOT open the system menu on the client side. Instead, ALT+SPACE is sent
    to the VNCServer.
    Pressing Break/Pause key toggles Full-Screen mode on or off.
    Pressing PRINT-Screen key requests a full screen update (same as selecting "Request Screen
    Refresh" from the system menu)
    All the above can be disabled by turning the SCROLL-LOCK key off.

  Options window. More clear for users.

 - Hopefully fixed the screen refresh locking after a
  FileTransfer occasionnal bug.

 - Simplified Viewer TitleBar display (removed "VNC
  Viewer". Was useless and now we can directly see
  the hostname in the task bar).

 - Added hostname in the FileTransfer window Title bar.

 - Hopefully fixed the scaling crash that occurs in
  all others VNC distributions due to the StretchBlt()
  function + hardware acceleration.
  Visual quality remains equivalent when scaled.

 - Added a 30s delay between 2 encoding changes when
  using Auto mode. It should prevent some problems
  over slow connections...

    - "ms-logon + no domain + WinVNC under win 9.x" case
    - OS Version is better checked when Video Driver is required by user

  - Fixed the scaling factors corruption problem when using "AUTO" quickoption in
    the viewer.

  - The DSM Plugins know their loader : vncviewer or WinVNC (application
    or service). It should be now more easy for plugins writters to save their plugins
    configuration at the good location in the registry, for instance.
    TestPlugin example source code has been updated consequently.





 ** RC 1.07 (v1 Release Candidate 07)

    scaling level.

  - Fixed Viewer crash when aborting connection
  - Remove Wallpaper after disconnection bug fixed
  - NTML mechanism now checks Local and Remote for Group and Password.
  - Fixed a bug with changes detection in WINVNC under W2K/WP: when the
    "Video Hook Driver" option was checked and the Video Driver was not
    actually available (not installed for instance...) then the default
    "System HookDll" was not loaded (even if the option was checked).
    The result was missing screen updates, especially with checkboxes,
    low accuracy and low speed. The workaround was to uncheck the
    "Video Hook Driver" option.

  - DSMplugin action now starts BEFORE the RFB protocole handshaking
    (-> 1.07 Viewer/Server DSM compatibility with 1.06 is broken
    but existing Plugins remain compatible with v1.07)
  - Info messages are now displayed when connection fails with DSMPlugin
    (Plugins incompatibility, missing etc...)
  - DSMPlugin now supports ms_logon method
  - Slightly modified TestPlugin sample
  - Added "dsmplugin" command line option in vncviewer

  - Video Driver handling:
    - Auto switching to default system hooking when 24bit color depth is used
      on server (the driver not used in this case)
    - 8bit color palette support
    - WinVNC keeps the attached-to-desktop bit to 1 until VNC unloads the
      driver -> No more crashes when an application changes the display
      (ex: pinball). No more risk that color depth or screen resolution
      switching crash the server.

  - New Video Hook driver v1.0.7 (+ New separate Video Drivers Auto-Setup)
