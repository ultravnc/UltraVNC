The source file uzexampl.c contains a short example showing how to call the
Win32 UnZip DLL from C. This code should work with all C compiler environments
that allow to build a >>working<< unzip32.dll binary.  This has been verified
with Microsoft Visual C++ (Version 6.0 [1998] and 8.0 [2005]) as well as the
free MinGW GCC compiler implementation.  The example code is a simple
console application that calls the UnZip dll to extract files from a Zip
archive.  The code assumes that the unzip32.dll binary is available somewhere
on the execution path.

If you want to build the UnZip DLL, the WinDLL usage example, or the WinGUI SFX
stub from the command line, you may use the MSC Makefile supplied in the
subdirectory of the Win32 command line port.

In the default setup, the UnZip DLL is linked against the shared C runtime
dll.  This configuration is most feasible for multi-module C/C++ based
programs.  For usage with non-C projects (e.g. Visual Basic 5/6 or MS .NET
managed code), a statically linked UnZip DLL might be more appropiate.
Both the Visual Studio projects and the MSC Makefile in the win32/ subdir
support statically linked builds through specific configurations (VC projects)
or a configuration switch (for details look into ../win32/Makefile).

Note that Borland C++ 5.0 is full of bugs; version 4.5 or 5.01 is recommended
instead.  If you must use Borland C++ 5.0, using the Intel optimizing compiler
is required to avoid crashes (possibly due to a bug in the stat() function in
the normal Borland compiler).  This does have the advantage of giving you a
smaller code size than the 4.52 compiler.  Borland C++ 5.01 has resolved many
of the problems seen with 5.0 and can be used reliably.
The UnZip DLL and SFXWiz have been successfully built with Borland C++ 5.5.1
from the command line. However, we do not currently have the resources to
supply project files for the Borland IDE environment (C Builder 5.x - 6.x).
For compilation with Borland C++, please use the appropiate targets supplied
with the Borland Makefile in the Win32 subdirectory.
